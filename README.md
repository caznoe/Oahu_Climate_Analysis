# Climate Analysis with Flask

Analyzed weather data for a hypothetical business proposal for a Surf and Ice Cream shop on Oahu. Used SQAlchemy to access historical weather data in a SQLite database. Graphed the data using Matplotlib and used Pandas for statistics. Created a webpage using Flask to share the results with the client. Project for UC Berkeley Data Analytics Boot Camp.

Further analysis done on June and December information for the project. Precipitation results are below.

The June and December statistics are very close to each other. December has a higher max of precipitation, but the average for both months is very close. This low average should show that the shop will not have a drastic difference in business between the two months. The average temperature for June is only 4 degrees higher than December, showing that ice cream sales should be consistent between the two months. Further analysis should be done on the other months as December may not be the height of the rainy season in Oahu and there could be average weather in another month that will negatively affect business more.
